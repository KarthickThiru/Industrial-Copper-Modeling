#  The learning outcomes of this project are:

 1. Developing proficiency in Python programming language and its data analysis
 libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and
 Streamlit.

 2. Gaining experience in data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing
 values, outlier detection, and data normalization to prepare data for the machine
 learning modeling.

 3. Understanding and visualizing the data using EDA techniques such as
 boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots.

 4. Learning and applying advanced machine learning techniques such as
 regression and classification to predict continuous and binary target variables,
 respectively.

 5. Building and optimizing machine learning models using appropriate evaluation
 metrics and techniques such as cross-validation and grid search.

 6. Experience in feature engineering techniques to create new informative
 representations of the data.

 7. Developing a web application using the Streamlit module to showcase the
 machine learning models and make predictions on new data.

 8. Understanding the challenges and best practices in the manufacturing domain
 and how machine learning can help solve them.
